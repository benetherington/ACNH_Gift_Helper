Animal Crossing New Horizons has a lot of interesting gameplay mechanics. They're a lot of fun to interact with organically, but it's also fun to understand and take advantage of the details. In particular, I've enjoyed playing with flower genetics and villager clothing preferences.
This app matches clothing items to villagers that really like them, and provides a checklist to help you keep track of purchasing and giving clothing items as gifts.

This repo is intended as an example of my work. Use the app at [acnhgifts.anvil.app](https://acnhgifts.anvil.app/).
